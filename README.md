###  What I Learned
- How JWT authentication actually works
- How the backend & frontend communicate securely
- State management and API calls in React
- Securing database resources by user ownership
- Deploying full-stack apps to Render & Vercel

###  Future Improvements (optional)
- Replace SQLite with PostgreSQL
- Add monthly totals / charts
- Better styling / animations

###  Status
**Project complete and deployed.**  
This is my first full-stack application and a foundation for much bigger builds.
